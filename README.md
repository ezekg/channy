`channy` is a Go channel-like observer that allows easy orchestration of arbitrary
events. It lets you to get rid of binding events to DOM elements (because those
aren't very reusable across elements), and instead, to let `channy` message the
members of a channel. As stated above, this is loosely based on the _flow_ associated
with Go's channels. I use this library for most of my projects, so I figured I
should stop copying and pasting it and keep it nice and versioned. :+1:

## Install
```
npm install channy --save
```

Or with Bower,
```
bower install channy --save
```

## Usage
`channy` is a static class, so you don't need to instantiate it with `new`. It
is responsible for managing global channels. A channel name should be namespaced
(for example, "namespace:channel"). See [inline documentation](src/channy.coffee)
for detailed breakdowns on what each method does, otherwise see below for
some basic usage.

```coffee
chan = require "channy"

chan.join "chan:channy", (x) ->
  console.log "hello, #{x}"

chan.message "chan:channy", "channy"
# console.log => "hello, channy"
```

#### Open a channel
Open up an empty channel. `open` takes a channel name and returns `void`.

```coffee
chan.open "a:channel"
```

#### Close a channel
Close a channel. `close` takes a channel name and returns `void`.

```coffee
chan.close "a:channel"
```

#### Join a channel
Join a channel. This will automatically create the channel if it doesn't already
exist. `join` takes a channel name and callback function and returns
`void`.

```coffee
chan.join "a:channel", (args...) -> # ...
```

#### Leave a channel
Leave a channel. This will automatically close the channel if no subscribers
currently exist for it. `leave` takes a channel name and callback function
and returns `void`.

```coffee
callback = -> # ...

chan.join "a:channel", callback

chan.leave "a:channel", callback
```

#### Message a channel
Send a message to a channel, executing all callbacks currently subscribed.
`message` takes a channel name and an infinite number of arguments to be
passed to the callback function, and returns `void`.

```coffee
chan.join "chan:channy", (x) -> console.log "hello, #{x}"

chan.message "chan:channy", "channy"
# console.log => "hello, channy"
```
